MV stands for "MultiView". This game was written as part of an article that never got
written. It seemed a shame for it to just sit on my hard drive, but it's not polished 
enough to bother putting on the App Store, since there are already several other 
better implementations of BlackJack already. But, there is code in here that may be
of use to people. There are two categories that may be of interest to people.

NSArray-Shuffle will shuffle the contents of an NSArray, returning a new array
with the same contents, but in a new, random order. I use this for shuffling the
deck of cards used in the game.

NSMutableArray-QueueAndStack adds methods to NSMutableArray that allow you to use
NSMutableArray as a stack or a queue, which works well in this situation, because 
dealing from a deck is essentially the same thing as popping from a stack

CardView might be of interest to some people, as it shows how to implement a view
with rounded corners.

This is not a complete or polished application, but it's a good example of a simple
MultiView application.
